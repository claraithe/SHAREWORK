# SHAREWORK

A collaborative platform for sharing work items and tasks with ChatGPT.

## Overview

SHAREWORK (TURNI 2024) is a system designed to facilitate seamless collaboration between users and ChatGPT for managing, tracking, and completing work items. This tool enables you to share tasks, get AI assistance, and maintain organized workflows.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create and organize work items
- **AI Collaboration**: Share tasks with ChatGPT for assistance and automation
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor task completion and status
- **Easy Integration**: Simple interface for sharing work context

## Quick Start

### Sharing Work with ChatGPT

1. **Create a work item** with the following structure:
   ```
   Task: [Your task description]
   Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
   Context: [Any relevant background information]
   Expected Outcome: [What you want to achieve]
   ```

2. **Share with ChatGPT** by providing:
   - Clear task description
   - Relevant files or code snippets
   - Specific questions or areas where you need help

3. **Collaborate** by:
   - Reviewing ChatGPT's suggestions
   - Iterating on solutions
   - Implementing recommendations
   - Tracking progress

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Code Review Request
```
Task: Review Python data processing script
Priority: High
Context: Script processes customer data from CSV files
Expected Outcome: Identify potential bugs and performance improvements
Files: data_processor.py
```

### Example 2: Documentation Task
```
Task: Create API documentation
Priority: Medium
Context: RESTful API with 10 endpoints
Expected Outcome: Complete OpenAPI/Swagger specification
```

### Example 3: Bug Fix
```
Task: Fix authentication issue
Priority: High
Context: Users unable to login after recent deployment
Expected Outcome: Identify root cause and implement fix
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed task descriptions
2. **Include Context**: Share relevant background information
3. **Set Expectations**: Define what success looks like
4. **Iterate**: Work collaboratively through multiple exchanges
5. **Document**: Keep track of decisions and changes

## Work Item Template

Use this template to structure your work items:

```markdown
## Work Item: [Title]

**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Status**: [Not Started/In Progress/Review/Completed]
**Created**: [Date]

### Description
[Detailed description of the work item]

### Context
[Background information, requirements, constraints]

### Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

### Expected Outcome
[What should be achieved]

### Notes
[Additional information, links, references]
```
